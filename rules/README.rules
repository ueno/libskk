* Format of rule files

Each file under keymaps/ and rom-kana/ directories is in the following
format:

{
  "include": [
    <parent>,
    ...
  ],
  "define": {
    <map>: {
      <key>: <value>,
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}

The value associated with "include" is an array of parent rules, which
will be included before evaluating the rule to be defined with
"define".  The value associated with "define" is an object which binds
some variables to values.

** Path name resolution

Each element in "include" may be either a relative or absolute path.

A relative path does not include "/" while absolute one does.

If path is relative, the rule is located under the same directory of
the current rule file.  Otherwise, libskk looks for the file outside
of the diretory where the current rule file is located.

Example:

If the current rule file is <root>/foo/rom-kana/foo.json and it contains:

  "include": [ "default" ]

it looks for <root>/foo/rom-kana/default.json.

If the current rule file is <root>/foo/rom-kana/bar.json and it contains:

  "include": [ "default/default" ]

it looks for <root>/default/rom-kana/default.json.

** Format of keymap rule files

The map name "keymap" is used to associate a key event to a command name.

Example:

{
  "include": [
    "default"
  ],
  "define": {
    "keymap": {
      "Q": null,
      "C-@": "start-preedit"
    }
  }
}

This rule includes "default" rule first, replace mapping of
"start-preedit" from "Q" to "C-@" (control + "@").

The current available commands are:

abbrev
abort
commit
commit-unhandled
complete
delete
insert-kana-<kana>
kuten
next-candidate
previous-candidate
set-input-mode-<mode>
special-midasi
start-preedit
start-preedit-kana

** Format of rom-kana rule files

The map name "rom-kana" is used to define romaji-to-kana conversion
rules.  The value is an object which maps a string to either an array
or null.

If the value is an array, a new mapping is defined.  In that case each
array can contain 2 to 4 elements.  The first two elements are
<carryover> and <hiragana>.  <carryover> is a string which will be
added to preedit after the transition (for example, when "bb" is
typed, "b" is <carryover> which will be added to the next preedit).
<hiragana> is an output in hiragana.  The rest of those elements are
<katakana> and <hankaku-katakana>, which are optional output strings
in katakana and hankaku-katakana input mode (automatically derived
from <hiragana> if they are omitted).

If the value is null, existing mapping of the corresponding key is
removed from the parent rule.

Example:

{
  "include": [
    "default"
  ],
  "define": {
    "rom-kana": {
      "xka": [ "", "か", "ヵ", "ｶ" ],
      "b.": [ "", "ぶ" ],
      "dha": null,
    }
  }
}

This rule includes "default" rule first, defines new mappings for
"xka" and "b.", and removes a mapping "dha" from the current rule.
